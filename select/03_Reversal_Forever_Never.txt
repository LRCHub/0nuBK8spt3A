I Rearrange, and Made a change.

So what I've been,
Is now what I see.
Surprised at myself,

I'm not like that.

Hate myself,
I'll grow to stand tall,
Til this nothing becomes all.

Same Again
I've made amends,

But I'm not the only one.
Save, Save, Say my name,
And I'll be there when you fall.

Heal my ways,
My walls are down,

Feelings numb,
I'm silenced by your words.

Holding On,
Last Breath will be,
The Last You hear from me.

Same Again
I've made amends,

But I'm not the only one.
Save, Save, Say my name,
And I'll be there when you fall.
