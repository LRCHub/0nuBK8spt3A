Out on the ice
A volunteer puts powder on a sled
So far there are no signs of what the packet said

Out on the ice
If looking through a telescope
Is looking down a wall
The mind is charmed and flatness now is depth
The wide white tower sheer
There he clings
Soaked bat
Then what spectrum gleams beside the tower base?
He sees it in the evening through the window square

Out on the ice
He swoons, his water boils
Yes, he nodded and a star was born
Provisions and a helicopter plan
The faintest glim inside the skin
A feather brushed his neck
Some color shifting in the blood

There he clings
Soaked bat
Looks out
Looks down
He swoons, his water boils
What spectrum gleams beside the tower base?
He sees it in the evening through the window square
