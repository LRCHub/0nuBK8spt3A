Wonder who's taken you
Now God has forsaken you
I thought I was waking you
I see I'll just shaken you

There's no fear in the heaven, the sky
Accidentally born, same when you die
I'll pledge my allegiance to the flesh and the stone
I wander this garden alone

Wonder who's taken you
Must to have mistaken you
Nobody's making you
The pressure that's breaking you
The dirt that is caking you

There's no fear in the heaven, the sky
Accidentally born, same when you die
I'll pledge my allegiance to the flesh and the stone
I wander this garden alone

Will I have some in a minute if you got it
Tried to look so very distant on your bonnet
I'm not expecting you to like it, but try it
But I have the little something, if you buy it

There's no fear in the heaven, the sky
Accidentally born, same when you die
I'll pledge my allegiance to the flesh and the stone
I wander this garden...

(Wonder who's taken you
Must to have mistaken you
I thought I was waking you
I see I'll just shaken you)
