[00:10.91] Tony, your life's not over
[00:14.87] But you've given up all you lived for
[00:17.39] Put the bottle down
[00:20.20] And fix the thing you ran from
[00:35.20] 
[00:23.29] Do you say what you really mean?
[00:26.12] Are you really how you're perceived to be?
[00:28.93] If the lights go out tomorrow, would you know?
[00:51.93] 
[00:34.78] I don't wanna call your family
[00:37.65] And tell them to build a coffin
[00:40.94] Because their oldest son just overdosed on pills
[00:46.40] You've got a red glare in your eyes
[00:49.79] And the sky outside your door's a blacker blue
[00:53.52] I hate to see what's become of you
[01:10.52] 
[01:01.68] Tony, it's just a stick in the spokes
[01:13.55] It's not too late for you to find your way home
[01:16.12] Because your friends are still here
[01:18.21] And your family's where you left them
[01:36.71] 
[01:21.82] So put on a clear head and try it out for a ride
[01:25.09] Because you're better than this
[01:26.47] And you can better your life, you can't choose your father
[01:30.35] We're suffering together
[01:42.35] 
[01:33.64] I don't wanna call your family
[01:36.61] And tell them to build a coffin
[01:39.35] Because their oldest son just overdosed on pills
[01:45.10] You've got a red glare in your eyes
[01:48.38] And the sky outside your door's a blacker blue
[01:51.96] I hate to see what's become of you
[02:08.96] 
[01:58.88] You're getting closer to the end of your rope
[02:09.04] I never thought you'd let yourself get so cold
[02:21.48] But lately I've been thinking
[02:25.52] About all the things I said to you
[02:42.52] 
[02:29.16] And now I need to prove that
[02:33.56] I didn't mean it when I said
[02:37.31] That you were dead to me
[02:41.25] You mean the world to me
[02:53.25] 
[02:47.75] I don't wanna call your family
[02:53.03] And tell them to build a coffin
[02:56.48] Because their oldest son just overdosed on pills
[03:01.94] You've got a red glare in your eyes
[03:05.29] And the sky outside your door's a blacker blue
[03:09.02] I hate to see what's become of you
